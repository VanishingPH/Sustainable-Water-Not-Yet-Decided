2022 WIT Hackathon Prompt


Technology is defined as the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. For this reason we look to challenge your technical abilities to create innovative practical solutions to tackle this year’s 2022 Google X AWS Hackathon. With an ever changing world and a demand for more resources, sometimes we overlook the simple things. This year’s hackathon will be centered around Goal 6 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September 2015. 

The summit was an opportunity that allowed Australia to actively participate in international discussions to design the 2030 Agenda and support the involvement of all development factors. Goal 6 is to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all members of society. This is both a domestic and international agenda that is well aligned with Australia's interests - especially in promoting regional and social stability for all. We believe that something as simple as water and sanitation should not be a privilege but a human right for all. As such a sustainable strategy is no longer a ‘nice to have’ but it is a business imperative. 

Which is why we challenge you to join us at the Google X AWS Hackathon and create innovative solutions to further the goal of ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all members of society.

Challenge - Summary

Provide a way Australian businesses can sustainably future proof themselves and simultaneously address one or more of the challenges that Goal 6 addresses such as sustainable management of water and sanitation for all members of society. 

Each team will follow UN Sustainability goal 6, as well as a technology that they believe can be applied to help Australian organizations build a digital roadmap.

Participants are free to choose or develop technologies they want to incorporate into their digital roadmap/strategy however some potential technologies are given.
